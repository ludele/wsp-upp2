		title: 'Zootopia 2\'s NEW Taming Party Scene!',
		content: `In the sequel, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde sneak through the aquarium filled with koi fish and a building where Victoria's taming party is taking place.

		They watch as Koslov presents Victoria with her tame collar and together they do the speech that welcomes Victoria into the Zootopia community. Despite Victoria being excited to receive her collar and becoming a "big spectacled crocodile", Koslov hesitates to put it on at first, but finally snaps the collar on her neck with a touch of sadness.
		
		Victoria is overjoyed and turns to face the crowd's praising as green balloons drop. Victoria is getting more and more excited even as her host tries to warn her and she ends up being shocked by her tame collar. With a hurt look on Koslov's face, Victoria turns to look at Koslov and runs to embrace her host (him).
		
		The new animals in the taming party are crocodiles, peacocks, vultures, and frogs instead of polar bears.`,

		content: 'During development of Zootopia, the team supposedly reached out to people in the Furry Fandom, and viral video making Zach King got a minor cameo in the final movie... Are we hoping for more of that kind of interaction in Z2? Minor not-quite-celebrity cameos and behind-the-scenes fandom interactions?',

		title: 'A little detail I noticed',
		content: 'So in Zootopia we all know the predators cannot eat meat. However, we can clearly see in certain shots that they have sharp teeth. Teeth evolved for eating raw meat. Judy states in her play that Zootopia was established thousands of years ago by predators and prey and one of the very first rules was to not eat each other. Thousands of years is at least a little time for things to evolve and change and we can see that the teeth on predators has barely changed at all despite their new diets. There isn\'t much need for sharp teeth anymore because there is no meat to consume. Therefore, predator teeth should at least look a little flat due to their new diets. That\'s my little thing about this movie that I don\'t like, but please keep in mind that I still believe Zootopia is the best film ever made and everything else about this movie over shines this small detail that very few have noticed.',

		title: 'Fan-theory.',
		content: 'Since in Zootopia, we only see mammals, and only them. No reptiles, no birds, no fishes, no insects etc. Do they not exist in Zootopia universe? Maybe they do. Another what if theory, what if Zootopia is basically like the kingdom/haven for Mammals? Then let\'s just say Nick and Judy had a new adventure, they tried to leave outside Zootopia and much to their discovery, them Mammals are not alone. They encounter animals not like their species. They somehow cross paths with Reptiles, Birds and more. Pretend Zootopia is the Mammals\' place, and other places outside Zootopia belong to Reptiles, (E.g.: Zootopia is North, the Reptile sanctuary is South, Birds to the East, to the West, Fishes? Insects?) Maybe the animals had a history, the reason why they\'re separate? Conflict perhaps? Maybe that needs to be resolved for unity? Forgive me if this theory is poor and mediocre or useless.',
